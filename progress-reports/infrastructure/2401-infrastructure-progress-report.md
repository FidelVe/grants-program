# Tracker Monthly Report

This is a progress update for 12/2023 on infrastructure provided by sudoblock including development of the tracker, indexer, and operation of RPC endpoints being used to support the ICON ecosystem.

### Summary

This past month's development activities involved the normal frontend improvements along with backend changes in preparation for IISS 4.0 and stats endpoints. The largest time consuming item though was doing the purchasing in preparation for the bare metal install. All components have now been purchased, assembled, and are now being prepared to move into a data center.

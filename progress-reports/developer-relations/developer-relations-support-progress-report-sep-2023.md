## Intro
This progress report is for the contract work of Fidel Sanchez-Bueno in the Developer Relations teams. The report is from  01-09-2023 to 30-09-2023

## Summary

* Assisted to the ICON Workshop in Korea during the first week of the month.

* Assisted Validators for the on chain registration of their public key. Most Validators didnt completed the process so we manually registered the public key of the majority of the validators in the chain.

* Improved documentation page and tutorial section on icon.community.

* Focused on improving the overall documentation for cross chain interoperability.

* Collaborated with the Discord admins for technical support on ICON-related development issues from community members and organizations.

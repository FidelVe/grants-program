# Nexus - September 2022 Progress Update

## Introduction
This is Nexus project developed by the ICONDAO team. This report reflects our development period from 1st September to 30th September.

## Summary
- Project status: Nexus testnet integration with NEAR blockchain.
- Sentiment: for the past month our team has focused on integrating NEAR testnet contracts, noticeable differences between NEAR and BSC have been found and adjusted to make it work with the current workflow design.
- Roadmap: aiming to continue monitoring Nexus services and launch NEAR mainnet integration in the coming month.
- Roadblocks: we unfortunately had a member unable to work due to his health condition. However, Lecle was quick to deliver an instant replacement to help us catch up with the launch plan.

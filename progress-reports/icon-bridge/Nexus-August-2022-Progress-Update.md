# Nexus - August 2022 Progress Update

## Introduction
This is Nexus project developed by the ICONDAO team. This report reflects our development period from 1st August to 31st August.

## Summary
- Project status: Nexus mainnet launched mode with focus on monitoring & services improvement.
- Sentiment: for the past month our team has focused on integrating BSC mainnet contracts, despite there were changes in the contracts itself during the integration, the launch has been smooth so far and we found no critical issues until now.
- Roadmap: aiming to continue monitoring Nexus services and integrate NEAR testnet in the coming month.
- Roadblocks: we unfortunately had a member unable to work due to his health condition. However, Lecle was quick to deliver an instant replacement to help us catch up with the launch plan.

# Nexus - July 2022 Progress Update

## Introduction
This is Nexus project developed by the ICONDAO team. This report reflects our development period from 4th July to 30th July.

## Summary
- Project status: staging and maintenance mode with focus on improving project development workflow and automation tests.
- Sentiment: for the past month our backend team has focused more on code optimization and node monitoring services. While we are dependent on the smart contract team, we think for the coming month there should be more work given to our backend team besides from integration such as RPC nodes monitoring & support.
- Roadmap: aiming to launch Nexus mainnet on 8th August under an assumption that all of the other dependencies are ready.
- Roadblocks: smart contracts ready for integration is our major roadblock.

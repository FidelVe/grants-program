__Roadmap amendments__
| Name | Change | Explanation | Dependants |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| Milestone 1 | Change date to July 3 from August 3 | We found a dangerous bug in the main code runner, so fixing this became a priority. Bug detailed [here](https://example.com). | Milestone 3|
| Milestone 2 | Change date from September 1 to August 10 | This looks to be easier than expected and is nearly complete | None |
| Milestone 3 | Change date from September 10 to October 1| Milestone 1 has been moved back by 1 month, so this moves back by 20 days to account for this | None |

## Amendments to budget

_As of now, [CPS](https://cps.icon.community) projects may not request amendments to the originally proposed budget_

_All budget amendment requests must provide strict and logical reasoning. The requester is susceptible to denial of request for budget amendment if the grant provider does not perceive this request to provide sufficient reason. Funding for CPS grants is available in bnUSD. Funding for ICON Foundation grants is available in ICX or USD_

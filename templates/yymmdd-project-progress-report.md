_Clearly formatted table_

__Roadmap amendments__
| Name | Change | Explanation | Dependants |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| Milestone 1 | Change date to July 3 from August 3 | We found a dangerous bug in the main code runner, so fixing this became a priority. Bug detailed [here](https://example.com). | Milestone 3|
| Milestone 2 | Change date from September 1 to August 10 | This looks to be easier than expected and is nearly complete | None |
| Milestone 3 | Change date from September 10 to October 1| Milestone 1 has been moved back by 1 month, so this moves back by 20 days to account for this | None |

## Amendments to budget

_As of now, [CPS](https://cps.icon.community) projects may not request amendments to the originally proposed budget_

_All budget amendment requests must provide strict and logical reasoning. The requester is susceptible to denial of request for budget amendment if the grant provider does not perceive this request to provide sufficient reason._

| Source | Amount [bnUSD, USDS, or ICX] | Time [days] | Notes |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | ---- | ----- |
| Person 1 | bnUSD 7000 | 10 days | This is the second developer. They will be necessary for an extra 10 days due to the change in expected completion date for Milestone 1 in the Roadmap Amendments |
| Service 1 | bnUSD 100 | 20 days | This is the service for providing X. It will be necessary for an extra 20 days due to the change in expected completion date for Milestone 3 in the Roadmap Amendments |
